## How to Use

1. Each day has its own directory (e.g., `day01/`, `day02/`, etc.)
2. Each day contains:
   - `solution.cpp` - Your C++ solution
   - `input.txt` - Your puzzle input (download from adventofcode.com)
   - `example.txt` - Example input from the problem description

## Building and Running

### Compile a solution:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 day01/solution.cpp -o day01/solution
```

### Run the solution:
```bash
./day01/solution day01/input.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. Go to https://adventofcode.com/2025
2. Read the day's problem
3. Copy your input to `dayXX/input.txt`
4. Write your solution in `dayXX/solution.cpp`
